Git is a fantastic tool. If you're working on your own, it allows you to track and manage changes to your files, save the state of your project when you think it important, and makes it straightforward to keep online backups of not only your current state of work but also the history of what's changed and when. If you're working with others it becomes an invaluable tool for facilitating collaboration on files, and for tracking who has done what and when.
