title: Why Git?
---

If you use Git properly, you will be able to relax knowing that all of your important work is safe and protected, and no matter what happens it will not be lost, corrupted, or over-written, and you can always retrieve it. We can undo changes and go back to any prior version, and can always see what has changed in our work, and when. It also allows us to collaborate with others, tracking their changes and contributions to a project.
