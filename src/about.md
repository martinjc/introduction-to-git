This course is intended as a brief introduction to the Git for people who have very little programming experience. It consists of this set of notes and some videos which repeat and this set of notes while demonstrating the usage of Git. 


# The notes

These notes are written in markdown and built using [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/). All notes are checked[^1] by [Proselint](proselint.com) and [Alex](https://github.com/get-alex/alex) for readability and inclusivity. This might not catch everything - if you see something that you think needs changing, please [let us know](https://github.com/martinjc/programming-intro/issues)!
